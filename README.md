This utility provides an easy option to add the doze / sit emote to your hotbar, without Cheat Engine or Mods / Launchers. <br>
It archives this by editing the HOTBAR.DAT config file, changing the last 2 emotes of the shared hotbar 8 to the respective emotes. <br>
<br>

# Disclaimer
I'd like to remind that this is editing the game config in not intendet ways. <br>
This utility is using native game features and not injecting code into the game, but usage of this utility this is at your own risk. <br>
It is probably not wise, to use these in any crowded area. <br>
